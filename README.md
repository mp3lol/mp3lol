- ðŸ’» I code in [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord - **mp3#9999**, [Email](mailto:mp3issexylol@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I code in batch for 2 main reasons; It's **interesting**, and it's **unique** in the way that not many people use it to code.
